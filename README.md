### Notes
I think the most difficult part of this assignment was configuring the collection view layout and trying to get it to look like I wanted it to. In general it's hard to remember syntax and particular steps but I think I'm getting the basics down, and the video walkthrough really helps. I keep running into issues with embedding the gifs no matter how small the file is, so I linked it.

My biggest challenge was navigating Xcode. Some of the buttons and layouts have changed since the walkthrough videos were first created.
